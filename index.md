* **Version 0.2** is tested to work with alpha Firebug 1.3 and Firefox 3.1.

## Installation

You definitely need [Firebug 1.4 or higher][firebug]. You also have to install Firefox Addon which is called [FireLogger][firelogger].

### Easy Installation

#### Firefox Addon
Preferred way is to [install this firefox extension][firelogger] via addons.mozilla.com.

#### Python Library

``sudo easy_install firepython``

### Install from sources

#### Firefox Addon

If you want to install latest addon from sources, you need to build it. 
It should be simple, but make sure you have these tools on your paths:

* git
* zip
* ruby and rake

Build steps:

    git clone git://github.com/darwin/firelogger.git
    cd firelogger
    rake
  
After that your XPI should be available in ``build/firelogger-X.Y.xpi``.

You should be able to install XPI file into Firefox: ``File -> Open File`` ... and browse for ``firelogger-X.Y.xpi``.

Remember, that you should be also using latest FirePython library on server-side (see next section).

#### Python Library

Just note, that it depends on simplejson (or some other json parsing library needed by [jsonpickle][jsonpickle]).

Clone [project from github][homepage] in your project directory.

``git clone git://github.com/darwin/firepython.git``

Or if your web project uses git for versioning, you may want to be cool and use firepython as a submodule of your git repository.
  
``git submodule add git://github.com/darwin/firepython.git relative/path/to/firepython``

In case firepython directory is not on your import paths, you need to add ``relative/path/to`` folder into your ``sys.path``.

## Usage

#### Django

After installation, enable middleware by adding its path in ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``: ``firepython.middleware.FirePythonDjango``. 

#### WSGI compatible

After installation, enable middleware ``firepython.middleware.FirePythonWSGI``.

#### Custom usage

Look for inspiration in [middleware.py][middleware-source]

### Real world examples

* [FirePython added to Bloog][bloog-example] (blog engine for GAE)
* [FirePython added to DryDrop][drydrop-example] (GAE hosting engine for GitHubbers && !Pythonists)
* [FirePython added to Pyxer](http://code.google.com/p/pyxer/wiki/FirePython) (Python web framework)

## FAQ

#### logging.debug("hello world!") outputs nothing, what is wrong?
> Default behavior of logging module is to output logs up from level INFO. Run "logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)" to see all logs.

#### Is there something similar for PHP?
> Check out [FireLogger for PHP](http://firelogger4php.binaryage.com), you may also want to checkout alternative logging tool [FirePHP](http://firephp.org)

#### Is there something similar for Ruby?
> Nope. I'd like to have one, but didn't find time to write server-side support. You are welcome to [hack it](http://wiki.github.com/darwin/firelogger)!

#### How can I change the name of the default logger?
> logging.getLogger().name = "my logger"

#### How can I open preferences?
> Switch to Logger panel and look to Firebug's toolbar. There is a green bug icon. It is a menu button! <a href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/darwin/firelogger/FireLoggerMenuButton.png"><img src="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/darwin/firelogger/FireLoggerMenuButton.png"></a><br/><a href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/darwin/firelogger/FireLoggerPreferences.png"><img src="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/darwin/firelogger/FireLoggerPreferences.png"></a>

#### Clicking on source-file links in Logger panel does nothing. How can I open trace-back sources in TextMate?
> Go to Firebug Menu -> Open With Editor -> Configure editors ... like this: ![TextMate hint][textmate-hint]

#### I was unable to download/install FireLogger extension from addons.mozilla.org. Can you package latest version for me?
> Some people reported this problem too. You may [try workaround][workaround].

#### How can I see Python profiling graph?
> 1. enable this feature in FireLogger preferences
> 2. setup a editor in External Editors in Firebug called "Graphviz" (the name is important!). It should be path to executable of a viewer for .dot graphs.
> 3. reload page and you should see info log line containing profiling info, clicking on the line launches configured Graphviz viewer (a filename will be passed as the first parameter)

#### When I start Firefox and page loads I don't see any log records, what is wrong?
> First page content was probably loaded from cache. Refresh your page and you should be ok.

#### My page does multiple AJAX requests to the same URL, I see logs for the first response, but not for others. Am I missing something?
> There is a bug in Firebug 1.4, it calls onResponse multiple times under some circumstances. That was very annoying, so I did a HACK and test for URL uniqueness in FireLogger. This will unfortunately filter out your multiple AJAX requests. Let's hope for fixes on Firebug side.
